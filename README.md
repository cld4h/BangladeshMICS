## Bayesian hierarchical generalized Poisson regression on Bangladesh MICS dataset

There are three main source code, each representing a seperate model

* `BP.Rmd`: The classic Bayesian Poisson regression model.
* `BHP.Rmd`: The Bayesian hierarchical Poisson regression model.
* `BHGP.Rmd`: The Bayesian hierarchical generalized Poisson regression model.

Please first run `BP.Rmd` `BHP.Rmd`, then run `BHGP.Rmd` to generate plots for comparison.

The simulation results are located in `data_output` folder. By default, it will load the previously saved Rdata file.
